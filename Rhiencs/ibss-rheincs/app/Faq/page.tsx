                              Managing Training is part of the overall Change
                              Management effort in an ERP project and needs the
                              desired attention. Lack of sufficient training /
                              irrelevant training can cause substantial delays in
                              project closure and prolonged settling down time. Best
                              practices are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                Embrace Training as part of the OCM Efforts. Follow
                                guidelines below:
                                <ul>
                                  <li>
                                    Ensure the Training Management plan is covered as
                                    part of the ERP Project Management plan and is
                                    signed off by the Steering Committee
                                  </li>

                                    Ensure the Change Network accepts the Training
                                    Management plan and carefully assesses the
                                    competence and capability of the trainers
                                    identified
                                  </li>

                                    Training Management plan must make sure that

                                    business process knowledge, training materials and
                                    a communication plan exists that communicates the
                                    training methodology to all users in the company

                                    Assess the training effectiveness very frankly and
                                    acknowledge capability / collateral gaps where it
                                    exists
                                  </li>

                                Adapt a Train the Trainer concept; This is a key
                                criteria in the selection of the ERP Core Team and the
                                key users

                                all users

                                challenge to upkeep training content if scope is not
                                well controlled; Ensure scope changes are tightly
                                controlled and only MUST HAVE exceptions are
                                accommodated beyond the design phase

                              it needed alignment to current realities and trends.
                              Signature is a KISS approach (Keep it simple and stupid)

                              implementation structure. It assumes there would be no
                              ‘Development’ which is healthy but not practical.

                              An unstructured approach to data migration can be a
                              major risk to a project causing significant delays and
                              cost overruns and a negative impact on all other
                              initiatives. It is absolutely imperative that a very
                              structured approach be adapted for data migration and
                              follow the implementation methodology – which pays very
                              special attention to data migration and prescribes a
                              very structured approach.
